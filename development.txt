I implemented ndice(n, *seed)
  returns 1 with a probability of 1/n

implemented mutate(mutfact, *seed, *chromo)
 it changes a chromosome by iterating through its bits and randomly
 flipping them with a probability of 1/mutfact
 (uses ndice)

implemented driver.c
 this is meant to illustrate how to use mutate to change a chromosome,
 it also has the intention of demonstrating how a chromosome can change
 given a mutfact
